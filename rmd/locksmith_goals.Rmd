## Overview of NC Locksmithing

In North Carolina, performing locksmith services requires a license from the NC Locksmith Licensing Board, obtained by being at least 18, having good moral character, passing an exam, and paying fees. Licensed locksmiths must also take reasonable steps to verify that the customer is authorized to access the property and must carry and present their license upon request. Some exceptions exist, such as employees working under direct supervision or individuals performing only administrative duties.
